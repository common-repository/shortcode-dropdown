ShortCode DropDown creates a dropdown containing all your site's shortcodes so you can easily add shortcodes in tinymce.

== Description ==

ShortCode DropDown is a plugin that allows shortcodes to be selected from a dropdown menu in the rich text editor for pages and posts. This is really useful because:
<ul>
<li> Authors can see which shortcodes are available.
<li> Authors do not need to memorize the names of shortcodes.
<li> The Rich Text editor (tinymce) is simplified for non-technical authors.
</ul>

ShortCode DropDown displays all the shortcodes available - the site's active theme and all its plugins. It is not restricted to a set of shortcodes defined by this plugin.

If some text is selected when a shortcode is selected, the shortcode is added around the text like this [shortcode]selected text[/shortcode].
However the attributes/parameters of a shortcode are not available through this plugin.

== Installation ==

Just install and activate the plugin.
